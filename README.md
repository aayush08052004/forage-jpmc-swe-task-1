# JPMC Task 1: Interface with a stock price data feed
The trader would like to be able to monitor two historically correlated stocks and be able to visualise when the correlation between the two weakens (i.e. one stock moves proportionally more than the historical correlation would imply). This could indicate a potential trade strategy to simultaneously buy the relatively underperforming stock and sell the relatively outperforming stock. Assuming the two prices subsequently converge, the trade should be profitable.
Most data visualisation for our traders is built on JPMorgan Chase's Perspective data visualisation software, which is now open source. If you want to explore that, a link is provided in the resources section.
Before implementing this request using perspective, first, you’ll need to interface with the relevant financial data feed and make the necessary adjustments to facilitate the monitoring of potential trade opportunities.
